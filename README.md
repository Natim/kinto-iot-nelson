# Driving a servo for the Nelson connected device

[Nelson](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/MinesTelecom/04018/session01/about)
is a fun MOOC project. It's a connected device that usually gets
orders (positions) from a remote django server. This experiment is to
instead get the orders from a Kinto server.
